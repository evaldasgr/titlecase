# titlecase
titlecase is a utility for renaming files in a directory to match English title capitalization rules.

# Usage
To rename files in the current directory just launch the utility with no arguments. Alternatively, a directory can be specified, and the utility will only rename files in that directory.
```sh
$ titlecase directory
```
